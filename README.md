# Concurrent-Traffic-Control-System
Implemented stoplight.c from OS161 from Operating Systems course at college. 

Given that this is a school project, I cannot make the code public due to honor code infrigement; if you are an employer or someone who is interested in seeing my work, feel free to email me at rmengle123@gmail.com.
